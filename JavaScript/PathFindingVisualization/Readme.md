# Path Finder Visualizer

The Path Finder Visualizer is a web application that provides visual trace of the search performed by various Path finding agents. It will support both weighted and unweighted graphs and will be undirected in the default mode. 

## Checkpoints for development
1. Define the grid for the graph
1. Translate the grid into an adjacency list
1. Enable the user to select a start and end point
1. Implement the algorithm that finds the path between the two
1. Show the visual trace of the agent
1. Enable the user to disconnect paths
1. Randomly make a maze on the grid to make the visualization more tangible
1. Add the menu bar that enables the user to cycle between various modes and algorithms
1. Refactor the code and refine the design
