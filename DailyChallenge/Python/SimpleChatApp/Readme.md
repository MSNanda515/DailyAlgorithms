# Simple chat room application

This application will teach me how to make custom backend for a chatserver using sockets

## Main bugs
- Importing modules from parent directory in python without tampering with the system files
- I tried using the normal flask routines but encountered a no of bugs with the functioning of the server
  - They can definitely be fixed but I will try a little differnet architecture this time
